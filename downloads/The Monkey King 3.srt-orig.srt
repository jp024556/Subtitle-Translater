1
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,684
Monkey King 3, BOUT TIME

2
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,062
Here comes the Monkey King….

3
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,606
wow unbelievable

4
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:50,069
HOW CAN YOOO DOOO DISS??

5
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,197
Mate…. How….

6
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,783
You are the best, Monkey King…

7
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,119
Even after hundreds and thousands of years

8
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,079
The demon wants to

9
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,040
Capture the three tribes at all Cost

10
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,167
The war between two tribes

11
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,130
The Sun and the Moon have no shining

12
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:50,249
Please don't , my clear fat brother

13
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,001
If you have to finish him off,

14
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:53,585
kill me first.

15
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,236
Didn't you always wish

16
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,238
The monkey and the pig

17
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,157
can get along?

18
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,910
I can make this wish come true

19
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,289
But it's fate that monkey and pigs
don't fall in love with each other

20
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:31,874
Dear brother

21
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,710
By giving him a chance...

22
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,212
you're also giving the whole world a chance

23
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,049
and me a chance

24
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,456
Look out for themselves

25
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,469
take good care of yourself

26
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,848
Attacking the Palace of Heaven is a major of fence,

27
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,475
I can't let him get away with it,

28
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,561
All monkeys will be demoted to the
Flaming Mountain from now on.

29
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,190
They will never be allowed in Heaven.

30
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,610
If any pigs dares to offend Heaven again,

31
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,280
the whole pig tribe will be exterminated.

32
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:13,434
Monkey boy seeing the
Palace of Heaven ruins badly

33
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,353
The endless natural disasters

34
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:20,315
They sacrificed themselves and turned
their body into thousands of crystals

35
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,025
to mend the war-trodden Heaven Palace.

36
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,904
She built the crystals Southern Heavenly Gate

37
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,408
to stop the pigs from trespassing

38
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,361
Monkey Faggot,

39
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,196
what brings you here?

40
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,989
Punjabiiiiiii,

41
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,783
I come here for a horny monkey.

42
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,786
He was born out of Pigs TESTICLES.

43
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,123
If taught and trained properly,
he could bring virtues to mankind.

44
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,418
But

45
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,294
this monkey was born
with both virtue and vice in him,

46
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,962
I'm afraid...

47
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,715
That's why you should teach him patiently

48
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,133
and turn him into a virtuous being

49
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,926
Where can I find this fat monkey?

50
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,850
on tinder…

51
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,703
I am coming

52
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,539
Here he comes

53
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:10,874
Here he comes again

54
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,308
Oh

55
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,227
Catch me!

56
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,159
Are you okay my friend?

57
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,585
It's dead

58
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,963
You are not it. How did you know it's dead?

59
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,173
You are not me.

60
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,800
How did you know I don't know it's dead.

61
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,387
I don't want it to die

62
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:08,617
Teach me

63
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,037
You really want to learn?

64
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,830
You're awesome

65
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,459
Okay. You follow me.

66
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,800
I am leaving,

67
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,636
take care yourself

68
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,180
I will be back soon

69
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,517
Can you still hear me

70
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,565
Can we fly faster?

71
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,248
In our clan, 12 names are used in

72
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,501
Rotation for newly recruited protégés

73
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,504
You are the most junior one in the 10th generation

74
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,465
Well

75
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,676
I have an idea

76
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,594
From now on

77
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:10,929
I name you

78
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,597
Sun Wukong

79
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:15,809
Sun Wukong

80
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,647
My name is Sun Wukong

81
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,695
Wukong

82
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,196
Yes, Wukong

83
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,280
How dare you!

84
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:42,836
Wukong,

85
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,754
you're talented

86
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,298
Let me teach you the 72 transformations...

87
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,800
the freezing trick

88
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,301
and give you the nimbus cloud,

89
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,888
But these are only tricks

90
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,349
You have to practice from your mind and thoughts

91
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,310
Do not slacking off

92
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:08,945
It's the chance the demon
tribe resumes power in Heaven

93
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,239
Your majesty,

94
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,993
this is what our ancestor prophesized...

95
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,080
The three signs that signal the
best timing to get back our ruling power:

96
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,260
Firstly, tsunami in the East Ocean

97
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,431
Southern Heavenly Gate cracked open

98
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,518
Lastly the crystal of Nuwa appears on Earth

99
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,229
This man was born

100
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,523
out of Nuwa's crystals

101
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,568
He has strong affinity with
the Southern Heavenly Gate

102
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,572
He must be able to help your
Majesty resume power in Heaven

103
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,950
With his magical power

104
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,078
I don't think he can break
the Southern Heavenly Gate yet

105
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,164
I need some “inside help” in Heaven

106
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,918
That would be Yang Jian, a.k.a. Erlangshen

107
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,379
This man wear silver robes and gold armour

108
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,090
and he controls half of the Heavenly army...

109
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,468
Jade Emperor only assign him to guarding
the Southern Heavenly Gate

110
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,970
He's been upset about it

111
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,224
This ungrateful watchdog must be able to help you,
your majesty.

112
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,310
The family doctrine of the demon
tribe finally comes true in my generation

113
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,064
The clay we break the Southern Heavenly Gate

114
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,526
Will be the day the Demon exterminate the Deity

115
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,946
We vigorously trained to combat for ages.

116
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,156
The battle against the
Heaven isn't necessarily a sure bet

117
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,201
The demon tribe might as well be defeated
and will forever by condemned and suppressed

118
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,879
From the moment we were born

119
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,632
We were destined to fight
for the glory of the Demon

120
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,135
Who dares to say something like that

121
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,556
Will just die as horribly as he did

122
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,398
Transform!

123
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:10,316
Transform!

124
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,114
Namo bhagawate,

125
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:16,865
transform!

126
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,667
Wukong,

127
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,085
what are you doing on the tree?

128
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,420
Come on down and practice!

129
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,839
I knew this trick long ago

130
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,340
Never mind him.

131
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,550
He's just bluffing.

132
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,094
A monkey will always be a monkey

133
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,263
Don't even think about being an immortal

134
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,097
That's true.

135
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,225
Don't think yourself as human with clothes on

136
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:02,619
I am not human being

137
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:03,745
I am not human being

138
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,372
Don't!

139
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,248
Get out of the way!

140
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,210
Why did you do that?

141
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,169
Don't worry. I'll get even with him.

142
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,809
Eldest protégé!

143
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:27,852
Come on!

144
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,200
Watch out!

145
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:19,862
Be careful!

146
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:24,659
Are you alright?

147
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,318
How you doing?

148
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,073
Here is Master!

149
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,203
Are you alright?

150
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:09,996
Let's lifted him up

151
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:12,999
Wukong

152
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,084
if you keep on acting immaturely..."

153
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,920
you'd never get to learn the most postive thing

154
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,215
I've learnt and perfected my 72 transformations...

155
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:21,924
I'm working very hard.

156
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,509
No matter how you can be protean

157
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,803
It's useless if your thoughts don't think positive

158
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:26,971
Master Puti.

159
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,556
It beat me up

160
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,682
They teased me, calling me a beast.

161
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:42,904
Wukong,

162
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,155
follow me.

163
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,204
It's OK.

164
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,755
Master where are you going?

165
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,272
Wukong,

166
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,857
have you awakened yet?

167
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:22,777
Awesome

168
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,904
Not really.

169
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,240
What did you just saw?

170
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,326
A dream

171
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,370
It isn't a dream

172
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,705
That is the fate of your life

173
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,166
That's right

174
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,795
Master, I met you

175
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,130
is my numeration

176
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,340
It is your numeration

177
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,385
You're destined to be struck by lightning

178
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,304
Burned by fire, blown by hurricane,

179
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,682
If you can avoid them, you'd live till the end of time.

180
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,600
But if you can't, you'd be burned to ashes

181
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,060
and you'd dissipate into thin air.

182
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,106
What should I do?

183
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,691
It's hard to say,

184
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:03,818
I will die.

185
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,528
All things alive must die one day

186
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,741
Is there tricks to resurrect the dead?

187
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,201
Teach me then I won't die.

188
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,038
I've taught you everything I can

189
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,666
You can rekindle if lamp off

190
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,252
As long as wick immortality

191
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,255
Where to learn this?

192
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,133
It depends on yourself, it's your numeration.

193
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:29,677
Master,

194
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:32,722
depends on myself

195
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,061
You want me out of the clan...

196
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:06,297
It's getting colder recently,

197
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,090
wear more.

198
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,009
Take care yourself

199
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:20,978
Nimbus cloud

200
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,628
Always have free time as a heavnly gate watcher

201
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,589
I thought you afraid to come

202
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,758
You are not scared that I can arrest you?

203
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:52,927
Needless to say

204
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,597
The fact that you showed up...

205
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,268
It mean you needed my have also

206
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,186
I am here to arrest you

207
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,438
After arrested you

208
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,649
I will awarded by Jade Emperor

209
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,901
The conrtoller of the army will be me

210
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,404
Are you still expecting from that useless emperor?

211
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,030
Between the three tribes,

212
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,949
who does not know you are skilled

213
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:15,825
Are you willing to just be a heavnly gate watcher?

214
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,285
Are you willing to just be a heavnly gate watcher?

215
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,371
Enough talk

216
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,624
You still need to count on me.

217
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,419
If you are attacking the Heaven Palace

218
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,462
I do not care

219
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,590
I just want the Heaven Palace

220
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,967
It seems the day of attacking the Heaven Palace

221
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,260
just around the corner

222
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,429
You don't have the ability to
break through the Southern Heavenly Gate

223
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,180
Anyone from the Demon tribe

224
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,890
approach

225
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,517
Will be burned to ashes if he comes near

226
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,813
That crystal monkey will be our major tool

227
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:55,823
The Demon King of Confusion is here

228
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,034
Run!

229
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,244
Run!

230
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:02,830
Run!

231
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,086
There a whole new world inside the Water Curtain Cave

232
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,345
Who dares to touch my monkeys

233
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,854
Don't you ever come to Mount Huaguo again!

234
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,857
Don't you ever come to Mount Huaguo again!

235
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,276
Okay okay. I won't.

236
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,278
I am sorry, please let us go.

237
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,008
You are our lord

238
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,177
The Handsome Monkey King of the
Water Curtain Cave on Mount Huaguo

239
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:04,600
The handsome Monkey king!

240
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,519
The handsome Monkey king!

241
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:07,687
The handsome Monkey king!

242
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:08,938
I am your Handsome Monkey King

243
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,815
I'll protect everyone

244
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:13,943
But

245
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,778
What if you're not here?

246
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,279
Who will protect us?

247
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:22,243
Don't panic

248
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:22,952
Don't panic

249
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,495
I'll find you some powerful weapons

250
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,246
Weapons!

251
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:26,997
Weapons!

252
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:28,874
Come on

253
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,334
Where are the weapons?

254
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,587
The water beneath the bridge is connected
with the Dragon Palace in the East Ocean

255
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,673
There are many rare treasures inside

256
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,925
But the Palace is located very deep in the sea.
It could be dangerous

257
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,345
If your majesty could bring back weapons

258
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,431
We can then protect ourselves

259
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,308
Wait for me

260
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,647
It's really high here

261
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,408
Time for dinner

262
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,785
Time for dinner!

263
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,703
I'm starving.

264
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,580
Time for dinner

265
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:16,589
I am so full

266
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,453
Good girl

267
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,290
I've taken care of you for so long

268
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,918
It's time you do something for me

269
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,922
Go to Mount Huaguo and look for your old friends

270
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,132
No matter what happens

271
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,717
Don't be scared

272
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:03,219
Don't get involved.

273
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:04,970
Don't ask questions.

274
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,139
Just stay by his side

275
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,476
Never reveal the relationship between you and me,

276
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,936
got it?

277
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:12,728
Ok

278
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,039
My friend

279
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,290
Let me tell you

280
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,959
I am giving you a chance

281
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,138
Listen to me

282
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,058
You guys are safe from now on

283
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,480
I saw a very mean fish

284
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,692
I saw a very mean fish

285
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,443
I killed it for you,

286
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:02,528
prizes for me?

287
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,362
You

288
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,614
You killed my marshal?

289
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,782
You

290
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,035
Who are you?

291
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:12,371
I'm your neighborhood

292
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,832
the Handsome Monkey King from Mount Huaguo

293
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,043
The reason I am here

294
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,338
I want to borrow some weapons from you

295
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,090
You come to borrow a weapon?

296
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,300
Turtle Minister,

297
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,968
bring out the weapons.

298
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:26,760
okay

299
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:28,637
Kill him

300
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:30,556
Ok

301
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:39,648
Dragon King, come on!

302
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:50,868
You fool me

303
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,817
This one works

304
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:24,985
Don't come over.

305
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:26,403
Transform!

306
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:30,824
Shrink

307
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,829
Your majesty,
why don't you just give him a second-rate weapon...

308
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:36,830
and drive this demonic monkey away quickly

309
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,290
We can complain to Heaven later.

310
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,918
Bring them out quick

311
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:41,585
OK

312
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:42,753
Bring out the weapons

313
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:02,648
Bring all in

314
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:03,774
Take all these away.

315
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:04,733
Take all these away.

316
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,614
What is this

317
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,784
These are cloud-walking boots

318
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,536
Gold chain armour

319
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,204
and phoenix-feather cap

320
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,622
It has a spiritual

321
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,833
It turns good on a good guy

322
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,459
turns bad

323
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,003
on a bad guy

324
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,547
Let's see if you're a good guy or bad guy

325
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,339
Transform!

326
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,723
Last time I wore it, I was a handsome guy.

327
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,184
Transform!

328
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,274
It looks bad on you

329
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,276
It looks bad on you

330
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:48,610
Not bad

331
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,200
Don't take away

332
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,368
It perfectly fits me

333
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,120
No, you can't take that away

334
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,414
They are the beloved treasure from
my brothers in the West, South and North Ocean.

335
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,708
I'll return it

336
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,964
You can't take that away

337
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:11,759
Come back

338
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,642
Monkey King

339
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,478
This is passed down from Yu

340
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,898
the Great to control flooding and calm the sea.

341
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,775
It's a piece of divine device.

342
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,819
You can't take it away haphazardly.

343
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:12,694
Dragon King

344
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,029
Never has anyone been able to pull the cudgel out,

345
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:15,322
don't worry.

346
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:18,033
Fine

347
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,537
If you can pull it out of the ground,
you'd go away with it.

348
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,705
I'll take your word for it

349
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,216
Lift

350
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:49,648
Shrink!

351
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:35,671
My dear. Are you okay?

352
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,269
Are you okay?

353
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:39,276
A mirage has no bounds;
rolling clouds block the sun

354
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:44,573
It's the crystal monkey who started the tsunami

355
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,576
It happened two signs out of three

356
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:50,579
It's time for the demon tribe to revive.

357
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,417
What happened at the East Ocean?

358
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,130
Nothing serious I think

359
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:01,548
Let me walk you to bedroom

360
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,850
Where are we going anyway?

361
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,101
We have to find a new home

362
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:14,644
We'll be there soon

363
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:16,104
I'm so tired

364
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:30,827
What is that about?

365
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:33,872
<i>Aw a'!</i>

366
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:34,664
<i>Aw a'!</i>

367
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,128
<i>Aw a'!</i>

368
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:46,051
<i>Aw a'!</i>

369
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,200
3103,

370
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,119
3104,

371
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,162
3105,

372
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,123
3106

373
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,126
What kind of spirit are you?

374
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,585
How dare you come to Mount Huaguo!

375
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,423
Speak up now

376
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,355
It's me

377
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,774
the fox girl

378
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,485
We met when we were little

379
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:47,821
Did you remember me?

380
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,074
I remember you, the fox girl

381
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:34,910
I remember you

382
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,203
Monkey boy

383
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,038
I was the monkey boy,

384
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,041
but now I'm Handsome Monkey King.

385
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:43,710
I'm Handsome Monkey King,

386
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,504
the one-and-only Handsome Monkey King.

387
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:47,172
Who is he?

388
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,507
Her boyfriend?

389
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:50,509
A monkey?

390
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,302
I miss you

391
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:54,846
Fox girl

392
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,057
What brings you here?

393
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,142
Our homeland

394
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,852
was ruined by the big wave

395
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:06,983
Was it yesterday?

396
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:08,860
The big wave?

397
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,237
Yes

398
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,406
You might live here

399
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,075
But I have a lot of companions

400
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,118
Do not know will bother you or not

401
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:18,453
It's alright, follow me

402
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:25,585
Don't worry

403
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,463
Slow down

404
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,385
This place is belongs to me

405
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:37,347
And this place too

406
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,183
And that one also

407
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,287
Wait here, I will be back soon

408
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:15,552
Dragon King

409
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,345
What happened?

410
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,555
Why the hurry?

411
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:19,931
<i>Yang Man</i>

412
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,892
My Dragon Palace was torn down

413
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,812
My treasures were wrecked

414
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,315
And my favourite item the
Ruyi Cudgel was snatched!

415
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,735
The four Kings from the East, West, South and
North Oceans have been in meeting for days.

416
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,195
South King is second oldest in our dragon family

417
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:37,157
West King is the youngest

418
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:39,659
North King third oldest

419
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,036
A final agreement was reached

420
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,996
We have to see Jade Emperor.

421
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:44,831
We have a complaint to lodge.

422
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:46,791
Who dares do such things?

423
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,461
A monkey spirit living in Mount Huaguo

424
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:50,712
Monkey Spirit

425
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:53,715
It's too trivial

426
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:55,634
to mention to Jade Emperor

427
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,303
I'll take care of it

428
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:00,930
Nazha

429
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:01,681
Yes

430
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,894
I want you to go to Mount Huaguo

431
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:07,604
And arrest that monkey spirit

432
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:08,521
Monkey Spirit

433
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,398
You act on behalf of the Heaven,
you can't make any mistake.

434
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:11,483
You act on behalf of the Heaven,
you can't make any mistake.

435
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,613
Does it make you tired with that thing on?

436
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,073
Don't you tired for asking so much?

437
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:35,715
Come on

438
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,429
Eat

439
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,015
You see my body hair,

440
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:44,641
it's bright and soft

441
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:45,558
Because I've been eating this since

442
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:47,394
Let's eat

443
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:54,651
I've known you for so long,

444
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:55,819
but I didn't know your name

445
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:56,861
I'm Ruxue

446
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:58,613
Ruxue

447
00:44:59,239 --> 00:44:59,989
I'm Wukong

448
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:00,699
Wukong

449
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,172
You used to be a monkey boy

450
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,384
Now you're the Handsome Monkey King

451
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:21,761
You have grown up too

452
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:22,846
You used to this small.

453
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,431
Now you're that big.

454
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:25,974
I'm still young.

455
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,392
120 years old this year

456
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:28,518
How about you?

457
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:32,897
I don't know how old I am

458
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:34,774
You look young

459
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:35,608
I guess

460
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:36,693
250 at most

461
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:37,777
250 year old

462
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:39,738
250. I'm 250 years old

463
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:41,114
250. I'm 250 years old

464
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,909
Minor spirits like me can live
for 200 more years at most

465
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,328
I'll die after 200 years

466
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:50,248
After death

467
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,291
You can resurrect

468
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,418
How will have that kind of luck?

469
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,546
That's why I cherish every day

470
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:58,423
I wake up daily to see the sunrise

471
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:00,300
Of course,

472
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:01,676
the sun rises every day

473
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,432
You see. It's the sunrise

474
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:31,122
The sun looks different today

475
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,211
The sun is real different today

476
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,171
Go!

477
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,047
What!

478
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:43,843
You monkey spirit!

479
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:44,928
You destroyed the Dragon Palace,

480
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:47,305
snatched the Ruyi Cudgel,
caused the tsunami in the East Ocean!

481
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:48,807
Also harboring other spirit

482
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:50,225
Now follow me to Heaven Palace for a trial

483
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,487
Who are you?

484
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,864
I'm Nazha, assigned
by Erlangshen for arresting you

485
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:05,657
Nazha

486
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,789
My tail is on fire

487
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,291
My tail is on fire

488
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,057
Are you okay, have a sit

489
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:34,394
Transform

490
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:41,401
Come on

491
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,742
Who are you?

492
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:18,706
Are you okay

493
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:19,415
I am fine

494
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,425
Your Majesty

495
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:34,389
Who are you?

496
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,432
He's the king of all spirits
from the Flaming Mountain

497
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,392
He's Buffalo Demon King

498
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:38,685
Thank you

499
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,186
It's nothing.

500
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:41,729
I just can't bear to see any injustice

501
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,690
It's not a bad idea to befriend with him

502
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,401
This is the king of all monkeys in Mount Huaguo,
the Handsome Monkey King

503
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:47,485
Never heard of him?

504
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:48,695
Monkey King!

505
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:49,570
Monkey King!

506
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,698
I'm Sun Wukong

507
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:54,575
You made that tidal waves happened?

508
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,041
Jade Emperor

509
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,168
The monkey spirit is doing bad deeds on Earth

510
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,378
He even made connections with the Demons

511
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:07,296
We have to track him down as soon as possible

512
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,215
He is not a monkey spirit

513
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,342
That naughty monkey Wukong

514
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:12,635
is my protégé

515
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,805
He was born out of the crystals
that Ma'am Nuwa used to patch Heaven

516
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:16,973
He was born out of the crystals that
Ma'am Nuwa used to patch Heaven

517
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,475
He has divine predisposition
and should've been enlisted as deity

518
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,519
He just need to be well educated

519
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:23,229
Jade Emperor

520
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,149
Though he's naughty and immature,
he's not evil in nature.

521
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,443
He just don't know how control himself well

522
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:29,902
And causes today's disaster

523
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,196
It was very kind and generous of Nuwa

524
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,157
To turn herself into crystals

525
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,992
and patch the Heaven

526
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,537
Thanks to her,
we've enjoyed thousands and hundreds of year of peace.

527
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,833
As Sun Wukong is born from her crystal

528
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,795
We should take care of him and educate him

529
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:49,630
Master Puti,

530
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:51,299
let's give him a chance.

531
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:58,556
Buffalo my brother,

532
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,016
this is for you

533
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:01,934
Thank you

534
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,439
I heard about the Handsome Monkey King's
heroic story long ago

535
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,107
You wrecked the Dragon Palace
and snatched a sacred weapon

536
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:09,984
Your magical power surpasses anyone in Heaven

537
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:10,610
But

538
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,820
I think the title Handsome Monkey King
doesn't do you justice

539
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,906
You need something more flashy and powerful

540
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:18,451
What is it then?

541
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,162
You are as powerful as Heaven

542
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:24,165
Let's call you

543
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,917
the “Great Sage equal of Heaven”.

544
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:32,965
“Great Sage equal of Heaven...

545
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:34,550
What a great name!

546
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,676
What a great name!

547
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:38,471
My dear monkey brothers

548
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:40,056
Don't call me the
Handsome Monkey King anymore

549
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,475
Call me the “Great Sage equal of Heaven."

550
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:44,894
Great Sage equal of Heaven...

551
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,522
You are such a nice guy

552
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:48,856
You know how to take name,

553
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,358
let's be my friend

554
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:51,192
Great Sage

555
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,069
You are born from Nuwa's crystal

556
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:54,403
You are

557
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,905
as powerful as Heaven

558
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,032
You are not suppose to just stay in Mount Huaguo

559
00:51:58,616 --> 00:51:59,784
I love this place

560
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:00,660
I don't want to go anywhere else

561
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:04,455
You should be belongs to Heaven Palace

562
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:06,541
The heaven

563
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,544
Could it be any better than my
ater Curtain Cave?

564
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:12,046
I heard Heaven Palace
is boundless and very beautiful.

565
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,048
Tell me

566
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,633
There is the 33rd level of Heaven

567
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:18,177
Some immortals have the ability
of "Resurrect the Dead"

568
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,439
"Resurrect the Dead"

569
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,401
I want to go to the heaven

570
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,820
and learn "Resurrect the Dead"

571
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,117
Who's in charge in Heaven Palace?

572
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:42,577
Jade Emperor

573
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:45,872
Where are you going?

574
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:48,249
I'll be an immortal in Heaven

575
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:49,709
and learn the trick to resurrect the dead

576
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,300
This is where we met the first time
when we were little

577
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,718
Wait for me.

578
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,720
I'll be back soon. Stay here

579
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:03,347
Don't make me wait for hundreds of years

580
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:05,892
Wait for me

581
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,070
Although this monkey spirit is powerful

582
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,405
And he learned his magic from Master Puti

583
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:21,657
He's still not powerful enough

584
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,326
To break the Southern Heavenly Gate

585
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,535
There is an elixir pill in Heaven Palace

586
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,705
Jade Emperor's elixir pill

587
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:29,540
It boosts one's magical power a hundreds times

588
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,584
But if you let this untamed monkey
have such magical power

589
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,669
Will he still listen to you?

590
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:34,879
I'll let him run loose

591
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,089
I'll instigate his hatred to fight

592
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,508
Regarding the Heaven Palace

593
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,012
You take care of the rest

594
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,530
This is the Southern Heavenly Gate,
the entrance to Heaven Palace.

595
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,282
How can a monkey spirit like you go through?

596
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,159
If I am a spirit

597
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,953
What about you with three eyes? A monster?

598
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:07,870
Who are you?

599
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,121
I'm Erlangshen

600
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:10,915
I'm in charge of the Heaven's security

601
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,584
The Southern Heavenly Gate is
off-limit to evil demons like you

602
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:15,336
Any of them who come close to it will
be burned to ashes by the crystals

603
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,462
I don't care who you are

604
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:18,464
I'm Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equal of Heaven,

605
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,800
the Handsome Monkey King from the
Water Curtain Cave at Mount Huaguo.

606
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,890
Is your eye on a wrong position?

607
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:29,475
What you're looking at?

608
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,729
"Thunderbolt from three generations"

609
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:34,647
"Pass through"

610
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:37,066
It's the day of I break though
the Southern Heavenly Gate

611
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:38,401
Oh

612
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,071
If you can pass through

613
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:43,281
I'm not going to stop you

614
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:45,700
But

615
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,119
You're so going to be burned to ashes

616
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:49,161
Because

617
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:50,830
You're a demon

618
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:52,248
Huh! I am Sun WuKong

619
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,541
Watch how am I get in

620
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:26,699
I'm coming in. I'm in.

621
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:28,701
I'm coming in. I'm in.

622
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,670
Your friend looks decadent

623
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,427
With so much stuff on his shoulders,

624
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,012
how could he be happy?

625
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,391
Go! Release!

626
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,394
Take a walk, have fun. Now, go.

627
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:37,561
That's strange

628
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,730
I've kept this Dragon Horse for so many years

629
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,732
He never let anyone except me to touch him

630
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:43,776
You're the only exception

631
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:46,153
Where's Jade Emperor?

632
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:47,363
The sovereign is here

633
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,280
The sovereign?

634
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:49,365
I am

635
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,284
You are the Jade Emperor

636
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,122
And you are Sun Wukong

637
00:56:59,083 --> 00:56:59,792
The sovereign is here

638
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:05,548
Please forgive him your majesty

639
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:09,093
Master Puti

640
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:09,802
Your majesty

641
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,222
My disgraceful disciple Sun Wukong
is new to Heaven, he got lost

642
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:14,473
I hope your majesty will forgive him

643
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,725
Wukong, come over.

644
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,310
Wukong

645
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:21,021
Senior sister

646
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,233
Long time no see, you look even more
beautiful after all this while

647
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,402
Wukong, your armour and cap look beautiful.

648
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:27,403
Really

649
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:28,070
Yes

650
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,530
I borrowed them. I'll have to return them later.

651
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:33,951
You looks great too

652
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:34,577
How impolite to chit chat in front of the Emperor!

653
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,455
Yang Jian, you take this too serious

654
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,004
I understand the irrepressible
joy of meeting old-time friends.

655
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,882
Sun Wukong, why are you looking for me?

656
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,300
I have to learn the trick to

657
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:50,217
" Resurrect the Dead"

658
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,052
Why would like to learn?

659
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:53,762
If I learned " Resurrect the Dead"

660
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,473
I don't want to see my monkey offspring

661
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:56,515
dying one by one

662
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,100
Please teach me

663
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:01,645
The road to deity isn't as simple as you thought

664
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:05,024
You need to accumulate experience
ancl practice for a long time

665
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:06,984
It all depends on you

666
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:08,527
Whether you can be a deity or not

667
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:12,615
When you understand the true meaning
of life and death one day

668
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:13,949
You'll see what I mean

669
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,495
Come over, you see.

670
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,456
This little Dragon Horse is so happy today

671
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,919
It seems like you know him very well

672
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:27,671
I'll name you the Heavenly Horse Keeper

673
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:32,009
From now on, you're in charge of
all Heavenly Horses and take care of them.

674
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,220
The sovereign likes you

675
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:35,471
Why?

676
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,765
Because you appreciate the sovereign

677
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:50,236
The Royal Stable is responsible
for training the Heavenly Horses

678
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,279
To accompany Jade Emperor when he travels

679
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,369
All horses are carefully groomed

680
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,412
Polite and absolute obedience

681
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:14,718
Hi everyone

682
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:17,972
From now on, I am your boss

683
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,223
My name is Sun Wukong

684
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,682
Am I awesome

685
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:07,187
Is it cool?

686
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:18,907
Let's go pee

687
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,117
No we can't

688
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,036
Is allowed only in Chen and You hours.

689
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:25,706
Well, then it's okay to eat, right?

690
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,041
No it's not

691
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,543
Food is allowed only in Si and Wei hours

692
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:33,756
Well, then drink some water.

693
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:34,840
No we can't

694
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,884
Water is allowed only in Yin and Wu hours

695
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,595
Give me a break. Even drinking water is scheduled?

696
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:40,471
Oh

697
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:42,306
The Heaven

698
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,308
is the sacred site for deities
to manage matters among the three realms.

699
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:47,478
Kneel. Right now

700
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,314
The law and order in Heaven
is stringent and must be strictly adhered to

701
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:59,573
You should kneel to anyone
with silver robe and gold armour on

702
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,117
Got it?

703
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:03,661
I'm the Great Sage Equal of Heaven

704
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:05,537
Will I kneel in front of
a three-eyed monster like you?

705
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:08,791
A beast is a beast after all

706
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,376
You don't understand deity language

707
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:19,927
Stop it!

708
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,852
Even a beast should be disciplined

709
01:01:39,655 --> 01:01:40,239
Does it hurt?

710
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:42,616
Of course it does

711
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:44,660
I'm the horse keeper

712
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:47,621
I'm in charge here

713
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:49,665
Alright, horsie

714
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:51,041
Let's go eat

715
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,588
Come back! Come back in!

716
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:09,810
Call the Heavenly army

717
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:07,785
This Peach tree

718
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,787
These over here take 6,000 years to blossom
and 6,000 more years to bear fruits.

719
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:11,079
Only privileged deities can enjoy the peaches

720
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:12,748
The other one take 9,000 years
to blossom and 9,000 more years to bear fruits.

721
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,541
I want to try the one takes 9,000 years

722
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:15,417
Of course

723
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:19,129
Where is he? He's gone! Search!

724
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:19,755
Yes

725
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,924
So many peaches. Where?

726
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:07,261
Sister, look

727
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:13,851
Got it

728
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:18,981
You horse keeper

729
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,858
How dare you eat the divine peach without permission?

730
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:23,235
It's just a peach

731
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:23,861
What's the big deal?

732
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:26,488
Only privileged deities can enjoy
the peaches at the banquet by invitation only

733
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,239
You?

734
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:29,575
I'm the Heavenly Horse Keeper personally
appointed by Jade Emperor himself

735
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,785
I just won't touch the peaches at the
banquet to make up for it then, okay?

736
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:33,745
You're far from being“privileged”
if you know the meaning of that word

737
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:34,788
How could you be possibly invited

738
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:37,416
What is “privileged?"

739
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,125
We're not high up in the heavenly hierarchy

740
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,209
but you're even lower than us

741
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,420
Then you're not “privileged."

742
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:42,170
Got it?

743
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:43,213
You can't tell the ranks of deities

744
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,549
Of course, it's not easy
to tell for small potatoes like you

745
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:46,508
Shame on you

746
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:47,551
No performance at all

747
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,469
Wanna to steal peaches

748
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:56,435
You guys are so noisy

749
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,013
Release

750
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:51,490
Your Excellency

751
01:05:54,368 --> 01:05:55,285
You're all injured

752
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,287
Did the monkey spirit do that to you?

753
01:05:58,497 --> 01:05:58,997
Yes

754
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:00,791
He even ate the divine peaches
without permission

755
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:10,342
Go and complain to Jade Emperor

756
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:11,802
Tell him how the monkey spirit

757
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:13,720
stirred up a fuss in the peach garden

758
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:16,932
Intentionally hurt you

759
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:18,892
Alright

760
01:06:29,528 --> 01:06:30,112
I'll do it now

761
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:41,456
Poke.

762
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:43,709
Wanna beat you long time ago

763
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:45,627
Enjoy it?

764
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:56,054
How dare you

765
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:57,973
How dare you hit me?

766
01:06:58,974 --> 01:06:59,850
I beg your forgiveness, your majesty.

767
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:01,810
The monkey spirit
was stealing the divine peaches

768
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:02,936
That's why I chase after him and hit him

769
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,521
Your humble servant

770
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,190
only wants to get rid of evil spirits in Heaven

771
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,443
We've grown so many peaches in Heaven

772
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:10,986
What for?

773
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,362
Aren't they

774
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:13,864
Only reserved for senior deity officials

775
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,199
How can they finish all those peaches?

776
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,285
How can they finish all those peaches?

777
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:20,829
Just give Wukong some

778
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:32,340
I told you to give Wukong some peaches.

779
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:33,467
<i>Sn"c that dear?</i>

780
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:36,428
Isn't that clear, huh?

781
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:37,763
This ungrateful monkey spirit!

782
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:39,181
How dare you offend the Emperor?

783
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,810
You three-eyed monster. Let go of my majesty.

784
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,624
Your majesty

785
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,002
The whole demon tribe
has followed your instruction

786
01:08:09,628 --> 01:08:12,631
They are prepared to sacrifice themselves
and use their souls to make the Demon Axe

787
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,510
The power of hatred and grievance in the
Axe is strong enough to destroy Heaven and Earth

788
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,347
I'm sure your majesty will defeat Jade Emperor with it

789
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,641
What are you doing?

790
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:36,822
You aren't supposed to come here at all

791
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,252
You promised me

792
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,171
You'd drop the grudges against the deities

793
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:55,674
And will never offend the Heaven again

794
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,435
That year

795
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,065
I left Heaven Palace and followed you here

796
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,236
I broke the rule that forbids love affairs
between demons and deities just to be with you

797
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:19,739
But why can't you just let go?

798
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:23,160
For the family doctrine passed
down from our ancestors

799
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:24,077
It's either Heaven

800
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:25,036
Or me and our kid

801
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:26,037
You pick a side

802
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:27,622
I want them both

803
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:36,381
Keep going

804
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,306
Don't worry

805
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:46,391
I'll take you back to Heaven one clay

806
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:49,436
And you'd live the happy life that you deserve

807
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,148
The Demon Axe is clone,
no one from Heaven can bear its attack

808
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:57,319
Let us revive the almighty demon tribe

809
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:12,519
There are so many huge stoves here.
What are they for?

810
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:17,190
So you are the celebrated Sun Wukong

811
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:20,110
MY majesty is

812
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,864
This is the place where the elixir pills are made

813
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:29,327
I'm collecting divine energy
to make the pills for Jade Emperor

814
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:43,633
Elixir?

815
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:46,303
Deities will have their magical
power multiplied after taking the elixir

816
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:49,681
One pill is worth 30,000 years of practice

817
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:52,267
Jade Emperor has been refining
his practice since young

818
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,894
He experienced 1,750 painful mishaps

819
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,814
Each of which lasts 129,600 years

820
01:11:58,273 --> 01:12:00,817
That's why he deserves
to take this pill of “no bounds and major wisdom,”

821
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:02,527
Which helps him manage the three realms

822
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,324
It's a restricted area in Heaven

823
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,702
You can't stay here. Otherwise, you'd be punished

824
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:56,748
Silly...

825
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,214
Master, why did you tie me up?

826
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,299
Because you are stirring up a fuss in Heaven

827
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:52,637
Arrest him

828
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,408
Beat him up

829
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,000
Now go ahead and fly

830
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:23,710
Do your flips and jump on your nimbus cloud!

831
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:27,255
Do your flips and jump on your nimbus cloud!Huh?

832
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:30,216
Do your 72 transformations!

833
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,051
What else can you do, huh?

834
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:33,303
Come on!

835
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:34,721
Is that all you've got?

836
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,558
You stole the divine peaches

837
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:41,227
And planning to steal Jade Emperor's elixir pill

838
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:43,646
Wukong, just follow the rules

839
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,190
If You plead guilty

840
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:46,441
You'd suffer less

841
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,068
I never thought about stealing the pill

842
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:50,612
You set me up

843
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,571
So, you're still not telling the truth

844
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:38,952
You want to burn down the lasso?

845
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:40,537
Go ahead and get in

846
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:41,621
Don't!

847
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:42,914
WukOng!

848
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:43,873
Listen to me

849
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,041
That's Samadhi Flame

850
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,042
It Will kill you

851
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:47,794
Fly right in there!

852
01:15:48,419 --> 01:15:49,087
Moron

853
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:50,797
Yang Jian!

854
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:53,716
WukOng!

855
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:54,801
Master

856
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:56,302
No matter dead or alive

857
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:58,054
It's my choice,

858
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:39,262
The three disaster

859
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:19,320
Remember my name

860
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:22,115
“Great Sage equal of Heaven”.

861
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,983
I am not a beast

862
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:12,623
Come on!

863
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:36,123
WukOng!

864
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:39,961
Let him go

865
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,254
I didn't teach him well

866
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:42,505
It's my fault

867
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,173
It's not you

868
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,592
He picked his choice

869
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,886
No one can stop him

870
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:50,763
Just let him go

871
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:44,543
"Resurrect the dead"

872
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,718
"Resurrect the dead"

873
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:05,022
"Resurrect the dead"

874
01:24:08,169 --> 01:24:08,961
Congratulations, your Majesty

875
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:10,212
For what?

876
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:11,422
Congratulations

877
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:12,631
on being bullied...

878
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:17,386
Congratulations

879
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:19,638
on us being bullied...

880
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:21,891
Think again

881
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:25,561
Congratulations,

882
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,564
your majesty, for us not being bullied any more

883
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:53,214
Is heavenly soldiers fire this up

884
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:57,051
Heavenly soldiers?

885
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,969
Why?

886
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:04,600
It's already a mess when I arrived

887
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:07,269
It's already a mess when I arrived

888
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:11,190
The heavenly soldiers killed all monkeys and spirit

889
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:13,484
Although you been breach of heaven

890
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,820
But it's nothing deal with your monkeys brother

891
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,488
The powerful heaven

892
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:20,116
Both you and I are those
whom Heaven wants to get rid of

893
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,450
If more hesitant

894
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,036
Mount Huaguo will becomes
other Flame Mountain

895
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:26,163
Great Sage

896
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:27,248
Today

897
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,876
Let's flight cooperatively

898
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,629
Against the Heaven

899
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,209
Vaisravana in the North, Dhrita-rastra in the East

900
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:55,002
Vidradhaka in the South, Virapaksa in the West

901
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:58,714
Don't come any nearer to Heaven

902
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:48,449
Ruxue,

903
01:28:50,701 --> 01:28:52,244
it's time you make your sacrifice

904
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:54,788
Why?

905
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,131
Because of love

906
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:06,842
He turns evil

907
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:13,932
This is the karma between the two of you

908
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:16,727
I start the karma, I ends with it

909
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,229
I beg you please don't hurt him

910
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:21,375
Let's fight!

911
01:32:37,928 --> 01:32:38,679
Go!

912
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,298
Here you come, Wukong

913
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:16,008
This fight seems inevitable

914
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,304
It's you who burned down my Mount Huaguo

915
01:33:20,429 --> 01:33:21,680
and killed my friends first

916
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:24,016
The Heaven wouldn't do such things

917
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:25,475
Listen

918
01:33:26,018 --> 01:33:27,352
I give a last chance

919
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:28,687
Come to your senses now

920
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:30,939
But I'm not giving you a chance

921
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:51,752
Master

922
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:04,890
Wukong,

923
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:07,601
the butterfly is dead

924
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:20,692
Come finish off this monkey demon!

925
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:33,789
You lied to me...

926
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:52,307
I am with silver robe and gold armour

927
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:56,102
The South Heavenly Gate Guard

928
01:38:54,596 --> 01:38:55,430
Wukong,

929
01:38:55,764 --> 01:38:57,182
what do you see?

930
01:39:01,436 --> 01:39:02,938
I see myself

931
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,065
But I don't see the truth of me

932
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,612
If you are born to be not dead

933
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:11,988
you're destined to experience
countless mishaps and catastrophes

934
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:17,494
If you repeatedly committing evil

935
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:20,497
What's the point of being alive

936
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:24,042
Lives seem unpredictable

937
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:25,001
Everything

938
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,836
have birth and death

939
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:31,007
As long as wick immortality

940
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,009
" Rebirth after death"

941
01:39:34,177 --> 01:39:35,428
Obsessed with continued

942
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:37,472
That's transmigration

943
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:48,108
"Resurrect the Dead"

944
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:23,059
Am I awesome?

945
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:13,873
No matter what you become

946
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:18,086
our child and I will be by your side

947
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:56,749
It's so seriously damaged

948
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:59,294
How long does it take to repair?

949
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:02,505
A few hundred years, I suppose.

950
01:45:05,425 --> 01:45:05,925
Really?

951
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:07,135
Really

952
01:45:23,401 --> 01:45:24,319
Sun Wukong.

953
01:45:24,569 --> 01:45:26,279
Where you want to escape to?

954
01:45:35,455 --> 01:45:36,622
I didn't plan to escape.

955
01:45:36,748 --> 01:45:38,791
I just want to fix and patch Heaven.

956
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,713
Numeration is out of your control

957
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:46,090
This is not your responsibility

958
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:48,760
It's your numeration.

959
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:52,096
Bounden duty of numeration

960
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:56,351
From now on,
you'd be trapped under Five-finger Mountain.

961
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:57,977
Make amendments from your mistakes

962
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:01,189
Once you reach an understanding

963
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:04,567
New numberation will come

964
01:46:05,902 --> 01:46:06,569
Fine

965
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:10,198
Buddha

966
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:12,492
Your hand is heavy

967
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:14,035
Cool!

968
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:23,711
Wukong is trapped under the
Five-finger Mountain by Buddha.

969
01:46:24,212 --> 01:46:26,672
He has to train himself for 500 years
to make up for his mistake

970
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:32,053
Waiting for another mission.
